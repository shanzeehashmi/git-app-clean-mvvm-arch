# Git App
##### With Clean Architecture, MVVM, Paging 3, Retrofit, Handled device orientation change, Dependency Injection with Hilt and Unit Testing

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/shanzeehashmi/git-app-clean-mvvm-arch)

Git App is build with clean architecture and mvvm design pattern leveraging the power of paging 3 to support infinite scroll and provides a great user experience
